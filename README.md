# random-password-generator


## Description

- I took this project on to learn how to learn how to pseudocode, learn the basics of javascript, learn the basics of utilizing for loops, if statements, and arrays. 
- This page allows a user to generate a random password based off of a series of inputs. The user will be prompted for how many characters and what type of characters they would like and the program will respond accordingly. 
- I learned many things on this project: How to prompt a user, how to gather and store user input data, how to manipulate arrays, how to use for loops, how to write functions and call functions, and how to use if statements to create a branching program.
